                        We studied the phenomenology of the formation of static structures with n kinks in models with deformed potentials. In order to study the binding forces between kinks I performed numerical simulations in the programming language Julia, additionally, I found an analytical relation for the energy of the static multikink. There's an article in preparation reporting our findings and we're planning to extend our study to higher dimensional topological structures in the future.

                        I studied the emergent phenomena in the behavior of the kink configurations arising from the topology of a generalized \(\phi^4\) potential. During this project I used perturbation techniques in order to renormalize the quantum mass correction of a kink configuration. By using asymptotic analysis we proved the existence of static multikink configurations and developed the framework to understand the stability of such fields.

                        I studied the possibility of having a well-defined photon wave function starting from the photon's dispersion relation and then letting the theory go checking for consistency. The appropriate quantum operators and Lorentz transformations were constructed by using elements of group theory to find the representations acting on the proposed 6-component wave function. After obtaining the lagrangian density the expected symmetries of the theory were examined. I worked under the tutelage of Dr.Manuel Torres Labansat at the Physics Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

<p>
                            I worked with Prof.Manuel Torres Labansat, studying the properties of topological solitons in potentials that have many local minima trapped between two global minima. We found that in many cases, the false vacuum pressure stabilizes the repulsive force between solitons, allowing for static multikink solutions. In addition, I simulated the collision between the multikinks of a modulated double sine-gordon potential we proposed. The generalization to higher-dimensional topological solitons arising in gauge theories and their interpretation is a potential research topic, and we have plans to work on it in the future. I presented this project at the AMC National Physics Congress, and there's an article in preparation for reporting our results.

<p>
                            Due to the particle like properties of solitons, it's natural to ask whether they have a corresponding one-particle state in the quantum theory. In this project I quantized around the kink solutions of a generalized \(\phi^4\) potential which allowed for static multikink solutions. Given the non analytic behaviour of the potential, solving for the normal modes in the kink sector was highly non trivial. However, with a suitable transformation the eigenvalue equation can be cast as Pöschl—Teller Schrödinger equation. The force between interacting kinks was also calculated using asymptotic analysis. This project led to an <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-6528/abdd83" target="_blank">article</a> published in 2021.

<div class="project-content">
<div class="project-text">
<p>
                            While doing research for my BSc thesis I learned a really valuable lesson about how science advance. Sometimes when trying to answer a really hard question you end up answering another, sometimes easier, unexpected question (or many). That's how I arrived to one of my favorite articles, "The fate of the false vacuum" by Sidney Coleman.
                        </p>
<p>It turns out that, in field theory, it's impossible for a system at a higher energy vacuum (false vacuum) to decay to a vacuum with lower energy (true vacuum) by standard means. An infinite amount of energy would be necessary to turn all the false vacuum into true vacuum at the same time in all space. However, Coleman theoreticized that in field theory the tunneling occurs through the nucleation of true vacuum bubbles which later expand at near \(c\) speed. Of special interest are the tunneling rates which are calculated by using Coleman's formalism. Coleman's formalism involves finding solutions to the non-linear field equations in Euclidian space, the solutions are an special kind of non-topological solitons called bounces.</p>
<p>While working with Prof. Manuel Torres Labansat on a generalized \(\phi^4\) model, we noticed that our model was adecuate to study the vacuum decay phenomenon. As a result we found a general set of virial relations that reproduce two well known results in scalar theories with vacuum decay and lead to more relations whose interpretation has still to be studied.</p>

                            Can we have a well defined photon wave function in position space? Are Maxwell's equations already quantum? does the position operator make sense for photons?. Motivated by the above questions, I started my research journey.
                        </p>
<p>This was my first research project, along the way, I constructed the photon wave function, found its wave equation, constructed the Hamiltonian and Spin operators, learned and applied representation group theory to further examine the transformation properties of the wave function, and, worked with the expected symmetries of the theory to prove they hold.</p>

                    The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered high luminosity galaxies that appear to be "too many" and "too massive" compared to predictions of the Standard ΛCDM cosmology, suggesting that star formation in the early universe is more rapid than previously anticipated. In this paper we examine in detail the following three effects which can instead provide alternative explanations for these observations: (1) a "top heavy" initial mass function (IMF) for the stars (high mass stars produce far more light than low mass stars), (2) a variety of star formation histories (constant, exponentially decreasing, and peaked star formation rates), and (3) a variety of initial metallicities. Due to any of these three effects, galaxies of a given luminosity in JWST may be interpreted as having a larger stellar mass than they actually do. Our results are obtained using the Pégase stellar population code, and are presented as the ratio of the modified star formation efficiency relative to the fiducial one (which uses a Salpeter IMF and constant star formation rate).

                    We study a scalar field model in a two dimensional space-time with a generalized \({\phi }_{G}^{4}\) potential which has four minima, obtaining novel kink solutions with well defined properties although the potential is non-analytical at the origin. The model contains a control parameter δ &gt; 0 that breaks the degeneracy of the potential minima, giving rise to two different phases for the system. The δ phases do not possess solitary wave solutions. At the transition point δ = 0 all the potential minima are degenerate and three different kink solutions result. As the transition to the δ &gt; 0 phase takes place, the minima of the potential are no longer degenerate and a unique kink φδ solution is produced. Remarkably, this kink is a coherent structure that results from the merge of three kinks that can be identified with those observed at the transition point. To support the interpretation of φδ as a bound state of three kinks, we calculate the force between the kink-kink pair components of φδ, obtaining an expression that has both exponentially repulsive and constant attractive contributions that yields an equilibrium configuration, explaining the formation of the φδ multi-kink state. We further investigate kink properties including their stability guaranteed by the positive defined spectrum of small fluctuations around the kink configurations. The findings of our work together with a semiclassical WKB quantization, including the one loop mass renormalization, enable computing quantum corrections to the kink masses. The general results could be relevant to the development of effective theories for non-equilibrium steady states and for the understanding of the formation of coherent structures.

<p class="hero-description">
                        Hi! My name is Jonathan. I am a Ph.D student at the Heavy-Ion group of <a href="https://ph.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">the University of Texas at Austin</a> working in the field of Heavy-flavor angular correlations to understand the properties of quark gluon plasma and colored backgrounds with the ALICE experiment. I'm also interested in theoretical physics specially the study of field of topological and non-topological solitons, Higgs physics, electroweak symmetry breaking, strong CP problem axions, collider phenomenology, and effective field theory applications.
