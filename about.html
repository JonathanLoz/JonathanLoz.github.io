                        Hi! My name is Jonathan. I am a Ph.D student at <a href="https://ph.utexas.edu/" target="_blank"> the University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am interested in theoretical physics specially the study of topological and non-topological solitons, quantum systems, collider phenomenology, and effective field theory applications. I am also interested in the study of Heavy-flavor angular correlations to understand the properties of quark gluon plasma and colored backgrounds.

                     I got my BSc at <a href="https://www.unam.mx" target="_blank">the National Autonomous University of Mexico</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.fisica.unam.mx/es/personal.php?id=63" target="_blank">Manuel Torres Labansat</a>. My BSc research focused on studying the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries in scalar theories in a potential with two continuous vacuum families. Besides, I studied the properties of topological and non-topological field configurations such as kinks, vortices and instantons. I am also studyng mechanisms to produce static multikink configurations using deformed potentials with a degeneracy parameter. I'm passionate about quantum field theory, in particular, the topics of physics beyond the standard model, vacuum decay, effective field theories, and non-perturbative fenomena in field theories.
